                (we did not get). As an Indian cricketer, I have travelled unreserved from Hyderabad to Delhi by train,
                as an India player," Mithali was quoted by PTI as saying at a session of 'We The Women' initiative.

                “He [Rahul Dravid] said he has never travelled in train as an India player, but I did. But those
                difficulties make us strong. As women we face so many challenges at an early stage, that when we mature
                and take up the challenges, we become so strong mentally, that we can do so many things, that we
                ourselves don't believe that we are capable of"
