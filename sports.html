    <h3>
        <ol>
            <li> In women’s sports we talk a lot about equal pay. The focus of the conversation is usually on how women
                make
                less
                than men, the unfairness of the disparity despite the equal amount of work they put in, and how female
                athletes
                often have to work full-time jobs on top of being full-time athletes.</li>

            <li>The US women’s soccer team has brought the conversation to the forefront over the last three years.
                After
                they
                won the World Cup in 2015, it was revealed that the US women’s team were paid a quarter of what the men
                earned.
                This was despite the women generating $20m more than the men that year.</li>

            <li>The women’s national team filed a wage discrimination act against US Soccer, and in turn received a
                significant
                raise, increased game bonuses, improved per diem stipends, better travel benefits, and more financial
                aid
                for players who are pregnant or adopting.</li> But that was not enough.

            <li>In March, the women’s team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against US Soccer. The media lasered in
                on
                the equal pay portion of the lawsuit, but ignored other facets. And there’s one issue in the lawsuit
                that is more
                important than equal pay: the argument that the women’s team is not marketed or promoted as much as the
                men,
                which leads to lower attendances and merchandise sales.</li>

            <li>This point should not be ignored. In fact, it should be the headline, but writing “Women’s soccer
                doesn’t
                receive as many marketing dollars” isn’t as attention grabbing as “Women’s soccer team, wildly more
                successful than the men, makes less than half of what men earn”.</li>

            <li>US World Cup winning coach Ellis was paid less than the men's U-20 coach. Why?</li>
            Jill Ellis, the manager of the US women’s national team, has been getting results. She led the USA to a
            spectacular Women’s World Cup victory in 2015 – which turned out to be very lucrative for her bosses at the
            US
            Soccer Federation – and just recently, the US women qualified with ease for this summer’s tournament in
            France.

            But the financial rewards for her success have been limited, at least compared to her male colleagues who
            have
            achieved far less. According to US Soccer’s newly filed public financial disclosure, Ellis was paid less
            than
            four different coaches who worked on the US men’s failed qualifying campaigns for the 2018 World Cup and the
            2016 Olympics, including two youth coaches.

            In fact, Ellis was the 10th-highest paid employee at the federation with $318,533 total compensation for the
            2017-2018 fiscal year – even though she’s the only one on the list who has won a world championship for the
            federation. Those who were paid more? Jürgen Klinsmann, who was issued $3.4m in severance after being fired
            over
            the US men’s disastrous start to 2018 World Cup qualifying. Also paid more was Bruce Arena, who earned $1.4m
            for
            taking over as coach and losing to Trinidad & Tobago, a result that ensured the US missed out on Russia
            2018.

            As if the optics weren’t bad enough, the men’s under-20 coach, Tab Ramos, who works with other youth teams,
            was
            also paid more than Ellis at $345,297. Andi Herzog, an assistant coach to Klinsmann who led the under-23
            men’s
            team in a failed bid to qualify for the Rio Olympics and was fired shortly thereafter, also got paid more
            than
            Ellis last year at $363,534.
